{"name":"NADEEF","tagline":"Rule based Data Cleaning Framework in Java","body":"# NADEEF <img src=\"https://travis-ci.org/daqcri/NADEEF.png\" />\r\n\r\n### What is NADEEF?\r\n\r\nNADEEF (or ''clean'' in Arabic, نظيف) is a commodity data cleaning system developed by the data analytic group at [QCRI](da.qcri.org). \r\n\r\n### See it in Action\r\n\r\nLaunch NADEEF using command \r\n```\r\n    Usage: nadeef.[sh | bat] [OPTIONS]\r\n    Options are:\r\n        console : start the NADEEF console.\r\n        dashboard : start the NADEEF dashboard.\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore details on the instructions can be found in the [User Guide](https://github.com/daqcri/NADEEF/wiki/User-Guide).\r\n\r\n### Goals of NADEEF\r\n\r\n**Being a commodity data cleaning system, NADEEF aims to be extensible, generic and easy-to-deploy.**\r\n\r\nMost existing data cleaning methods and systems, either in industry or academia,\r\nemploy different types of data quality rules in isolation, each time a new data cleaning problem arises or\r\na new type of rules is considered, practitioners either build a new system from scratch or go through a painful\r\nprocess of customizing an existing tool. The NADEEF team designed a new data cleaning system that distinguishes\r\nbetween a programming interface and a core to achieve generality and extensibility.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\nhttp://da.qcri.org/publications\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nNADEEF is released under the terms of the MIT License, (http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
