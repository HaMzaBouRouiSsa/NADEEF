{"name":"NADEEF","tagline":"Commodity Data Cleaning Framework","body":"### What is NADEEF?\r\n\r\nNADEEF (or ''clean'' in Arabic, نظيف) is a commodity data cleaning system developed by the data analytic group at [QCRI](da.qcri.org). \r\n\r\n### See it in Action\r\n\r\nLaunch NADEEF console using command \r\n```\r\n    nadeef.sh or nadeef.bat\r\n```\r\n\r\nMore details on the instructions can be found in the [User Guide](https://github.com/daqcri/NADEEF/wiki/User-Guide).\r\n\r\n### Goals of NADEEF\r\n\r\n**Being a commodity data cleaning system, NADEEF aims to be extensible, generic and easy-to-deploy.**\r\n\r\nMost existing data cleaning methods and systems, either in industry or academia,\r\nemploy different types of data quality rules in isolation, each time a new data cleaning problem arises or\r\na new type of rules is considered, practitioners either build a new system from scratch or go through a painful\r\nprocess of customizing an existing tool. The NADEEF team designed a new data cleaning system that distinguishes\r\nbetween a programming interface and a core to achieve generality and extensibility.\r\n\r\n### Publications\r\n\r\n* NADEEF: A Generalized Data Cleaning System\r\nThe 39th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases (VLDB demo), Riva Del Garda, Italy, 2013\r\nAmr Ebaid, Ahmed Elmagarmid, Ihab Ilyas, Mourad Ouzzani, Jorge Quiane-Ruiz, Nan Tang and Si Yin.\r\n\r\n* NADEEF: A Commodity Data Cleaning System\r\nACM SIGMOD Conference on Management of Data (SIGMOD), New York, USA, 2013\r\nMichele Dallachiesa, Amr Ebaid, Ahmed Eldawy, Ahmed Elmagarmid, Ihab Ilyas, Mourad Ouzzani, and Nan Tang.\r\n\r\n### License\r\n\r\nNADEEF is released under the terms of the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble or new ideas with NADEEF?
