==================

NADEEF (or ''clean'' in Arabic, نظيف) is a pioneering commodity data cleaning system developed by the data
analytic group at QCRI (da.qcri.org). Being a commodity data cleaning system, NADEEF aims to be extensible,
generic and easy-to-deploy. Most existing data cleaning methods and systems, either in industry or academia,
employ different types of data quality rules in isolation, i.e., methods for various types of rules are treated
as independent processes. A major problem we observed is that, each time a new data cleaning problem arises or
a new type of rules is considered, practitioners either build a new system from scratch or go through a painful
process of customizing an existing tool. The NADEEF team designed a new data cleaning system that distinguishes
between a programming interface and a core to achieve generality and extensibility.
