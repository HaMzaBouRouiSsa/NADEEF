### Goals of NADEEF

**Being a commodity data cleaning system, NADEEF aims to be extensible, generic and easy-to-deploy.**

Most existing data cleaning methods and systems, either in industry or academia,
employ different types of data quality rules in isolation, each time a new data cleaning problem arises or
a new type of rules is considered, practitioners either build a new system from scratch or go through a painful
process of customizing an existing tool. The NADEEF team designed a new data cleaning system that distinguishes
between a programming interface and a core to achieve generality and extensibility.
